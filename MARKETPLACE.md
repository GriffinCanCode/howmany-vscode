# Go to GitHub ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí Create a new release
# Use tag v0.1.0
# Add release notes from CHANGELOG.md
```

#### 3. Monitor Workflow
The GitHub Action will automatically:
1. Run tests and quality checks
2. Build the extension
3. Package the .vsix file
4. Publish to VS Code Marketplace
5. Upload artifacts

## üìä Post-Publication
